# JS-CMS
Js-Cms is a CMS that enables dynamic editing of pages that will be hosted on CDN or static pages providor (GithubPages etc.)

The content of the site can be edited dynamiclly as a normal CMS but then, instead of adding the new data to the DB - static html & JSON pages are created and uploaded to the cdn (USING the cdn API).

This enables the following features: 
* Hosting can be 100% Free  
* Super performance
* Track changes in the site using the commit.
* Easy rollbacks and all the benfits GIT features.
